# THEMES FOR FY25 - DRAFT

## Career strategy
- Where do I see myself in the Windows organization?
- Where is my experience valuable?
- Do I really want to be the "widget" guy?

## Less busy, more focus
- Get away from the menial design tasks
- Focus on the system and advancing it

## Make > design (Coded prototype)

# GOALS - Top 5
1. Strategy definition for the widget space

4. ...
5. ...

# PLAN


# CAREER PATH
1. More connection with MAI system design (Koehn's team) - How does web fit into Windows
2. Get another mentor or principle peer

# REFLECT
## Last year - 7-8 years at Microsft (FY24)
1. One year in Windows design
  - A decent amount of change in a year (3 managers, one rewards cycle)
  - Appreciate the focus on design quality within the design team (engineering and PM are lacking - have not seen this in other orgs)
  - The team culture is great - transparent, collaborative
2. I miss actually helping people achieve more
  - Not a huge fan of working in the "ad/promotional" space - did that, that's why I left agency
3. More connections, more consistent 1:1 with partners and leads

## Take-aways
1. Need to say "no" more, and have a plan for what I'll be doing with my time instead
2. More share-outs, more transparency, more feedback
3. More product design practice (hone visual quality)

# LONG-TERM
- Leading not managing (Vision not people)
- Work on storytelling skills

# OPEN QUESTIONS
- Get crisp on what impact looks like in Windows and as a principle designer?
  - Need the opportunity space
  - Then amplify the strategy and vision
  - Delivery-based approach (visual strategy, prototyping, )
- Which of my skills and experiences the most valuable? Focus on building those.
- Where can I leverage my development (HTML, JS, CSS) skills in Windows? Learn XAML?
- What opportunities are available to pursue more Responsible AI?
